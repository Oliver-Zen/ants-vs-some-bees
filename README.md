# ants-vs-some-bees
"In this project, [I] created a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. 
Ants protect their queen from the bees that invade [my] territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and [my] queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm, focusing on material from Chapter 2.5 of _Composing Programs_. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program."
